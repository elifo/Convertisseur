# Extended-source modeling in SEM3D starting from Ruiz's Integral Kinematic source model

* This repository includes the files necessary to prepare a finite source model that can be used as input for the 3D spectral element code of SEM3D (of Ecole Centrale Paris, IPGP and CEA).

* For the kinematic source modeling, we use the RIK model developed by Ruiz et al. (2011) and further modified by Gallovic (2016). The asperities (or seismic sub-sources) have a fractal distribution that can be adjusted to a pre-defined slip inversion data. 

* More details in [Manual](https://github.com/elifo/Convertisseur/blob/master/DOC/manual.pdf)
